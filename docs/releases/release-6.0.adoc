== Release 6.0 (NOT RELEASED YET)

=== New features and improvements

 - *basic `OpenAPI` support* - see `OpenAPI#bootstrap` (thanks to https://github.com/danielbraga[Daniel Braga] for https://github.com/rapidoid/rapidoid/pull/158/files[contributing]!)
 - included `Swagger UI` in the `rapidoid-openapi` module (visit `/api`)

=== Breaking changes

 - migrated to Java 8
 - merged the `rapidoid-essentials` module into `rapidoid-commons`
 - renamed the `rapidoid-http-server` module to `rapidoid-rest`
 - removed the support for service activation from CLI arguments
 - removed the "manageables"
 - separated the bootstrap of services out of the application bootstrap - please use e.g. `App.bootstrap(args); Boot.foo(App.setup()); Boot.bar(App.setup())` instead of `App.bootstrap(args).foo().bar()`
